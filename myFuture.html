            <h2>High School</h2>
        <p> I want to go to lakewood high school. I want to go there because of all the good programs like HOSM, Merit scholars, and also they have ATM.
             I also live right next to it so I’d be crazy not to go. However I also have a chance at going to a private school call St. Anthony's.
              I might have the chance to go here because of my football skills. They said that if I play for them they would let me in there school they would let me in at discounted cost.
              So even though I live right next to Lakewood it would be a cool experience to go to a private school so I'm kind of split right now.

            <h2>Collage</h2>
            <p>In For my collage I want to got LBSU. I want to go there because my mom went there and said that it would help me become a surgeon, which is what I want to be. 
                I also heard that it’s a really good school with great programs. Also the pyramid there is really cool and seeing that every  morning would be cool.
                I am also interested in UCLA. I would also like to go there because of their excellent medical program. And since I would like to be a surgeon this would be very good
                for me. I would also like to get away from my home not to say that I don't like my home but it would be milestone if I were to move out of my house when I go to 
                collage.

             <h2>Career Intrests</h2>   
             <p>In the future I aspire to be a surgeon or go into the medical field in general. I want to be a surgeon because my mom is a nurse and she told me about all the benefits 
                 of being in the medical field like, you get to help people, you can save lives, and it pays well. I would also like being a pediatrician. This job interestes me because
                 I would still be able to help people. Also my pediatrician inspired me to go into the medical field in the first place so it would be a good job to have.

             <h2>My Goals</h2>
             <p>   My goals are to get at least a 3.7 in high school and in all As in college. I want to graduate with a doctoral degree and complete medical school.
                 I want to become a cardio vascular surgeon and work at local hospital.
                  And also most importantly I want to save lives and make a difference in the world no matter how small.
