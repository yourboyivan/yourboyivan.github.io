            <h2>Collage</h2>
            <p>In For my collage I want to got LBSU. I want to go there because my mom went there and said that it would help me become a surgeon, which is what I want to be. 
                I also heard that it’s a really good school with great programs. Also the pyramid there is really cool and seeing that every  morning would be cool.
                I am also interested in UCLA. I would also like to go there because of their excellent medical program. And since I would like to be a surgeon this would be very good
                for me. I would also like to get away from my home not to say that I don't like my home but it would be milestone if I were to move out of my house when I go to 
                collage.

             <h2>Career Intrests</h2>   
             <p>In the future I aspire to be a surgeon or go into the medical field in general. I want to be a surgeon because my mom is a nurse and she told me about all the benefits 
                 of being in the medical field like, you get to help people, you can save lives, and it pays well. I would also like being a pediatrician. This job interestes me because
                 I would still be able to help people. Also my pediatrician inspired me to go into the medical field in the first place so it would be a good job to have.
