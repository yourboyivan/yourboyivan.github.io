            <h2>7th grade ATM</h2>
            <p>In the first half of 7th grade we did mostly graphic design. We learned the basics of photoshop and illustrator.
                We also learned how to use InDesign which we used to make a fictional magazine cover which you can see below.
                In the second half we worked with sketch up and floor planner to make houses and lay out the interior of buildings. 
                Then we did coding with karel which widened our understanding of code.

             <h2>8th grade ATM</h2>   
             <p>In 8th grade we have mostly done coding so far. We used khan academy to learn the all about html and css. We then used 
                 Dash lessons to improve our coding stlye and now we just free code and do projects which require some-what complex code 
                 and careful and precise coding commands. My favorite 8th grade ATM project is the website I'm building right now.
