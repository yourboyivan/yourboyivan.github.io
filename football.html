            <h2>How I got into football</h2>
        <p> Ever since I could remember ever sunday on fall I would watch sunday football. Mainly we watched the raiders which led
            them to being my favorite team. When I was about 5 years old I started throwing around the football with my dad and my uncles.

            <h2>My Football Career so Far</h2>
            <p>I have been playing football since I was 8 years old. I started off with playing just to get the jist of the sport. 
                This past year I played tackle football. I played on a teamcalled the Lakewood Long horns and I usually played either center or tide end. In the future I want to play 
                tackle football all throuhout highschool. My favorite thing about playing football is all the hitting you get to do
                because I find it fun and I find it exhilarating.
